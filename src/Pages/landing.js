                    <p>Welcome to my extended essay! Thanks for clicking on the link. You will be asked to type a sentence 20 times (doesn't all have to happen in one sitting), and then your keystroke data will be used in my extended essay. </p>
                    <p className="font-bold text-blue-500 mt-4 mb-2">What does this mean?</p>
                    <p>The only thing that is being collected is the time between clicks on your keyboard, so don't worry about privacy. The data will be used in various experiments, in order to try and distinguish one person's keystroke data from another's. The ultimate goal is to determine whether this is a viable approach to detect and prevent account sharing on sites like Netflix. </p>
